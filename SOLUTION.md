Testing
Not aiming for full coverage of test cases within one test class but more for a full coverage of all classes.

1. JUnit testing to cover simple success scenarios. 
2. Controller testing - went for the restTemplate approach (expensive, full application server starts up) in the UserController class. 
Used Springâ€™s MockMvc to save on resources (time) for testing of the WithdrawalController. Two different methods
are used just to showcase different approaches - otherwise I would have been consistent, going with one approach for both services.
These tests could have been narrowed only to the web layer by using @WebMvcTest.
